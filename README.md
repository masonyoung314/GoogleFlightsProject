# GoogleFlightsProject
This project uses SerpApi's Google flights API to solve my problem of wanting a cheap flight from Amsterdam to Tenerife to see my girlfriend on Christmas. To do so, I call the API with my parameters 3 times per day (6AM, 2PM, and 10PM), returning the cheapest flight each day and then adding that to a list of the cheapest flights found any given day, and resetting the next day. At 11:59:59, the program outputs the cheapest of the three flights that day and then resets the list for the next day.
